A call centre or call center is a centralised office used for receiving 
transmitting a large volume of requests by telephone. An inbound 
centre is operated by a company to administer incoming product
 support or information inquiries from consumers. Outbound call 
centers are operated for telemarketing, solicitation of charitable 
or political donations, debt collection and market research. A 
contact centre is a location for centralised handling of 
communications, including letters, faxes, live support software, 
social media, instant message, and e-mail.

A call centre has an open workspace for call centre agents, with
 work stations that include a computer for each agent, a telephone 
set/headset connected to a telecom switch, and one or more 
supervisor stations. It can be independently operated or 
networked with additional centres, often linked to a 
corporate computer network, including mainframes, microcomputers
 and LANs. Increasingly, the voice and data pathways into the 
centre are linked through a set of new technologies called computer
 telephony integration.

The contact centre is a central point from which all 
contacts are managed. Through contact centres, valuable information
 about company are routed to appropriate people, contacts to be tracked 
and data to be gathered. It is generally a part of company’s customer 
relationship management.
