If you think you are beaten, you are.
If you think you dare not, you won't.
If you'd like to win, but think you can't, you won't.
If you think you'll lose, you're lost.
For out in the world, we find,
Success begins with a fellow's will.
It's all a state of mind.
Life's battle don't always go to the stronger and faster man.
But sooner or later the man who wins is the one who thinks h6546e can.
