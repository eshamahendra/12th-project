Domino's Pizza ,  is an American restaurant chain and international franchise pizza delivery corporation headquartered at the Domino Farms Office Park in Ann Arbor Charter Township, Michigan, United States, near Ann Arbor, Michigan. Founded in 1960, Domino's is the second-largest pizza chain in the United States and the largest worldwide, with more than 10,000 corporate and franchised stores in 70 countries. Domino's Pizza was sold to Bain Capital in 1998 and went public in 2004.
In 2012, Domino's Pizza changed their name to simply Domino's to emphasize their variety of non-pizza products. At the same time, Domino's introduced a new logo that removed the blue rectangle and text under the domino in the logo, and changed the formerly all-red domino to be blue on the side with two dots and red on the side with one dot.
